# Finished!
That's it. Well done!

By now you should have learned a bit about how it is to write and run code on microcontrollers. You should also have obtained a basic understanding of how containers on microcontrollers work, and what benefits they can bring.

In this case, all the applications you coded, compiled and ran, were run on a simulated board provided RIOT OS ecosystem. However, it could just as well have been run on an actual microcontroller. You would just have to issue the command to flash the firmware as well. Should you be interested to learn more about that, you can head over to over to [RIOT OS, Getting started](https://doc.riot-os.org/getting-started.html#building-and-executing-an-example).
